<h1> Kevin Josef B. Banglagan </h1>

<p> I'm Kevin Banglagan. I'm 18 years old. I'm from Pasay City. I graduated from St. Mary's Academy - Pasay City(JHS/SHS) </p>

<p> I'm more as a computer tech guy. I spend a lot of time on computer or playing computer games with friends. I like building, cleaning computer and
help friends who are in need creating their own computer setup. I want to travel to Korea, Japan, US to experience what's like being there because
I've been to Canada when was I young. I followed tech guys on social media platforms like (Linus Tech Tips, Bitwit, JayzTwoCents, GamerNexus, etc..).
I tend to eat a lot of food when I'm alone while using computer. 
I got the inspiration on computers when I was grade 5. My first computer was when I'm 11 years old with my brother-in-law.
He help me building my first computer setup and he was an I.T too, that makes me choose I.T as my course. </p>

<p> My expectation on this class is to help me creating UI/UX, techniques and have knowledge about the subject to make me a better I.T student. </p>
