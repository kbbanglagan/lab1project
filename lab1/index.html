<h1> Kevin Josef B. Banglagan </h1>

<p> I'm Kevin Josef Banglagan. You can call me Kevin. I'm 18 years old from Pasay City. I graduated from St. Mary's Academy - Pasay City (GS/JHS/SHS). Imagine being in one school for 12 years and received a loyalty award. I’m the youngest child among my siblings and we are 3. My sister is a nurse working on dubai and my brother is a chemical engineer and me now still studying to pursue my chosen course and graduate as an I.T student. I like playing music and play basketball. </p>

<p> I'm more as a computer tech guy rather than playing console. I spend a lot of time on computer or playing computer games with friends. I like building, cleaning computer and help friends who are in need creating their own computer setup. My first game that I was addicted to was League of Legends (PC game). When I was at highschool, my classmates are always going to computer shop after dismissal and play computer games. I got jealous to them because their having fun while me just browsing the internet back in the days to watch Youtube. They convince me to play the game with them, after a while trying the game, I got addicted easily and wanted to play the game everyday. I wanted to travel to Korea, Japan, US to experience what's like being there because I've been to Canada when I was young. I followed tech guys on social media platforms like (Linus Tech Tips, Bitwit, JayzTwoCents, GamerNexus, etc..). I wanted to be like them to help and also people trying to learn new things about technologies. I tend to eat a lot of food when I'm alone while using computer. Most of the time I watch tv series, vlogs, gameplays so I can sleep because I don’t know why. I got the inspiration on computers when I was grade 5. My first computer was when I'm 11 years old with my brother-in-law. He helps me creating my first computer setup and he was an I.T too, that also makes me get inspired and chose I.T as my course. </p>

<p> My expectation on this class is to help me creating UI/UX, techniques and have knowledge about the subject to make me a better I.T student. </p>
